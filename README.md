# Mixed Messages Project
### Random Message Generator Program

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to create a program (mainly using JavaScript) that generates a random message to a user.

I decided to build my program to generate random character profiles, including their name, some skills and a weakness, 
as well as their overall motivation and a catchphrase.

The technologies used in this course were:
  - HTML
